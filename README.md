Introduction
A rule-based chatbot is an automated program designed to simulate human conversation by providing preset responses to specific user inputs. This approach uses explicit programming logic—typically if-elif-else statements—to match user queries and generate appropriate replies. Rule-based bots are foundational for understanding how chatbots process natural language in its simplest form.

Design and Working Principle
Input/Output Loop:
The chatbot operates within a loop, continuously accepting input from the user and responding until an exit condition is met. This loop represents an ongoing conversation.

Rule-Based Logic:
The core of the chatbot is a series of if-elif-else conditions. Each branch checks the user's message for specific keywords or phrases (e.g., “hello”, “bye”, “help”). If a condition is met, a corresponding pre-written response is delivered.

Exit Strategy:
Certain keywords, such as “bye”, “exit”, or “quit”, are programmed to terminate the loop and end the chat session gracefully.

Default Response:
If the user input does not match any predefined rule, the chatbot returns a generic message prompting the user to rephrase or try a different query.

Features
Simple NLP Structure:
Relies on string matching rather than advanced language understanding, making it highly predictable and easy to follow.

Modular Expansion:
New responses and logic rules can be added easily by defining additional conditions.

User Guidance:
Offers help and information about its capabilities when prompted.

Limitations
Restricted Understanding:
The chatbot cannot process ambiguous inputs, variations in phrasing, or complex queries outside of its defined rules.

No Learning Capability:
It does not improve or adapt over time; all responses are manually programmed.

Applications
Educational Use:
Helps beginners grasp fundamental chatbot concepts and logic flow.

Prototype Development:
Serves as a template for designing more sophisticated conversational agents.
